# golang docker-compose

Using Compose is basically a three-step process:
- Define your appâ€™s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere.
- Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
- Run ``` docker-compose ``` up and Compose starts and runs your entire app.
